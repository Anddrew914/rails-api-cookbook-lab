# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.

# 1. Use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key.
# 2. Create a .env file in the root of this repository
# 3. Set your ENV variables in .env: i.e., SECRET_KEY_BASE_DEVELOPMENT=<your secret>

# Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
# if you're sharing your code publicly.

development:
  secret_key_base: <%= ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE_DEVELOPMENT'] %>

# Use different runs of `rake secret` for development and test
test:
  secret_key_base: <%= ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE_TEST'] %>

# Do not keep production secrets in the repository,
# instead read values from the environment.
production:
  secret_key_base: <%= ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE'] %>
